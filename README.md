# City Explorer

**Author**: Jonathan Staib
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview

  The purpose of building this application is to be able to search a city name and get information about city and to get a location of it pinpointed on a map.

## Getting Started

  I will need to create a react application that brings in a location API with all city names as well as a map API to bring in. Styling and functions will be utilized as well.

## Architecture

I will be using JavaScript, CSS and react(javascript) as well as Location APIs. 

## Change Log
